                    <h2>Lovers of Teruel.</h2>

                    <p>
                        The Lovers of Teruel (Spanish: Los amantes de Teruel) is a romance
                        story that is alleged to have taken place in 1217 in the city of
                        Teruel (Aragón).
                    </p>
                    <h2>Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        In the city there were two important and wealthy families,
                        Marcilla and Segura. Juan Diego Garces de Marcilla (also known as
                        Diego) and Isabel a Segura were their children. The two were in
                        love as childhood playmates but when they were both at an eligible
                        age to wed, Diego's family had fallen on hard times. Isabel's
                        father, being the most wealthy in all of Teruel, forbade the
                        marriage. Diego, however, was able to make an agreement with the
                        father in which he would leave Teruel for five years to try to
                        build his fortune. If Diego was able to gain wealth within those
                        five years he would be able to marry his love, Isabel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During those five years Isabel's father pestered her to marry
                        someone. She replied to him by saying that God wished her to
                        remain a virgin until she turned twenty, saying that women should
                        learn how to manage the household before getting married. Because
                        her father loved her dearly and wished for her happiness he
                        agreed, and for five years they waited for Diego's return.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Diego was not heard from in those five years and so on the day of
                        the five years' close Isabel's father married her to Don Pedro de
                        Azagra from Albarracín. Right after the wedding ceremony there was
                        a commotion at the Zaragoza gate. The watchmen informed the
                        village that Diego Marcilla had returned with great riches and
                        with the intent of marrying Isabel. Diego had not counted the day
                        in which he petitioned Isabel's father whereas the Seguras had.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That night, Diego sneaked into the bedroom of Isabel and her
                        husband and gently awoke her. He pleaded to her, "Bésame, que me
                        muero," (Kiss me for I am dying) and she refused, saying "No
                        quiera Dios que yo falte a mi marido," (God would not wish me to
                        deceive my husband) "Por la pasion de Jesucristo os suplico que
                        busques a otra, que de mi no hagais cuenta. Pues si a Dios no ha
                        complacido, tampoco me complace a mi." (For the love of Christ, I
                        beg you to find another, and forget about me. If our love could
                        not please God, then neither should it please me.) ...
